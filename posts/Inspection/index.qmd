Welcome! Here we go over Restaurants and their different rankings

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
restaurants_data <- read.csv("/Users/dylanemler/Documents/Files/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv")

ggplot(restaurants_data, aes(x = factor(BORO))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#66c2a5", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Restaurants Across Boroughs",
       x = "Borough",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))


```
This bar chart shows the how many restaurants are in all the different boroughs.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
restaurants_data <- read.csv("/Users/dylanemler/Documents/Files/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv")

ggplot(restaurants_data, aes(x = factor(`VIOLATION.CODE`))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#66c2a5", color = "black", width = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Violation Codes",
       x = "Violation Code",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 8),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) ifelse(seq_along(x) %% 5 == 0, x, ""))


```
This graph shows the the type of violation codes and how many restaraunts got that grade when they were inspected. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
restaurants_data <- read.csv("/Users/dylanemler/Documents/Files/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv")


ggplot(restaurants_data, aes(x = factor(BORO), y = SCORE, fill = factor(BORO))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Inspection Scores by Borough",
       x = "Borough",
       y = "Inspection Score") +
  theme_minimal()



```
This graph shows the distribution of inspection scores by each borough. Mannhattan and Queens had the highest rated restauraunts.
